# Merging and Updating Nested Objects with Spread Operator

## Problem Statement
Merge two nested objects (profile and updates) using the spread operator.  
Ensure nested properties inside address are also merged properly.

## Given Objects
```js
const profile = {
  name: "Charlie",
  age: 29,
  address: {
    city: "San Francisco",
    zipcode: "94101"
  }
};

const updates = {
  age: 30,
  address: {
    zipcode: "94109",
    country: "USA"
  }
};
